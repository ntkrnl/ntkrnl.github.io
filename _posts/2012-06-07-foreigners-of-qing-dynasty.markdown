> How can you _guarantee_ such a thing?
I mean, unless you found a way to decentralized ISPs or to provide satellite connection to all those living in China, they're still subject to whatever their government impose on their ISPs. And that's a government that really doesn't give a shit about freedom of expression or whatever.
Technically, they could go as far as switching their firewall to "white-list" mode and block everything which is not previously authorized. People are already used with such tyrannical kind of censorship in meatspace, anyways. Where I live, you need to be white-listed to own a gun, to drive a car, to attend to schools/university.... even to be a baker or to build a house in your own fucking land. **For almost anything you want to do, you have to be white-listed.** And yeah, to own a television channel or any other important press vehicle, you also need to be white-listed. They just need to adapt the twisted reasoning they use to justify such things in meatspace to the Internet to get people to accept it. Actually, the Chinese government in particular doesn't even need to mind much about such "acceptance"....

But well, I'm still curious about what "resilience method" you've come up with, as it's probably an improvement, nonetheless. ![Smiley](https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/smiley.gif)
